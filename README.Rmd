# pifpaf

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pifpaf is to estimate potential impact fractions and population attributable fractions using individual-level or aggregate data. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of pifpaf from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("pifpaf")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to estimate the PAF when 
individual-level exposure data is available to the user, where the relative
risk function takes the form $\text{RR}(x) = \exp(x) = 1.27$. 

``` r
library(pifpaf)
x <- rweibull(1000, 1.2, 1.66) # synthetic data
paf.emp(x, log(1.27), 0.002)

```

Now suppose the user does not have access to the individual-level exposure data but does know its mean and variance. This is typical in publications, where only
the mean and variance are reported. We can approximate the PAF using only the 
first two moments. 

``` r
paf.app(mean(x), var(x), length(x), log(1.27), 0.002)

```
